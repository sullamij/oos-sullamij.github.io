As the title machine 'Behaviour' suggests, this paper takes an 'behavioural' perspective in analysing machines' behaviour. 
The main assumption here is that artificial intelligent machines should be reckoned as not just engineering artefacts but as agents or actors situated in an environment, interacting with other components. 

> The consequential choices that we make regarding the integration of AI agents into human lives must be made with some understanding of the eventual societal implications of these choices. To provide this understanding and anticipation, we need a new interdisciplinary field of scientific study: machine behavior.
