As the title machine 'Behaviour' suggests, this paper takes an 'behavioural' perspective in analysing machines' behaviour. 
The main assumption here is that artificial intelligent machines should be reckoned not as engineering artefacts but as agents or actors situated in an environment, interacting with other components. 

> The consequential choices that we make regarding the integration of AI agents into human lives must be made with some understanding of the eventual societal implications of these choices. To provide this understanding and anticipation, we need a new interdisciplinary field of scientific study: machine behavior.

### **Framework** 
The main contribution and the crux of this paper is that it provides framework to understand the machine behaviour. The framework is essential to our ability to control their actions, reap their benefits and minimize their harms. 

The framework adopts the work of Tinbergen. Tinbergen's work has founded the field of ethology. It identified four complementary dimensions of analysis that help to explain animal behaviour. These dimensions are 'Function, Mechanism, Development and Evolutionary history of a behaviour'. 

> The behavioural study of machines can benefit from a similar classification. Machines have mechanisms that produce behaviour, undergo development that integrates environmental information into behaviour, produce functional consequences that cause specific machines to become more or less common in specific environments and embody evolutionary histories through which past environments and hunan decisions continue to influence machine behaviour.
