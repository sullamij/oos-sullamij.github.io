<center> Welcome to my site! The posts are mainly for organizing my research including brief summary of the papers and talks that I am interested in. My basic motive for research is to explore the complex dynamics of Artificial Intelligence and Socio-Technical systems and to suggest solutions for the problems that arises when deploying AI in the real world. In particular, the keywords of my research are "Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics in AI" and also "Human-In-the-Loop" issues, investigating methods to complement human intelligence and artificial intelligence. If you have any comments or questions, feel free to contact me via my <a href="mailto:sullamij@gmail.com">mail</a> </center>
