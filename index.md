Hi There!🙋🏻‍♀️Welcome to my site! The posts are mainly for organizing my research. It includes brief review of the papers and talks that I am interested in. My basic motive for research is to explore the complex dynamics of Artificial Intelligence and Socio-Technical systems and to suggest solutions for the problems that arises when deploying AI in the real world. In particular, the keywords of my research are <b>"Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics in AI"</b> and also <b>"Human-In-the-Loop"</b> issues, investigating methods to complement human intelligence and artificial intelligence. If you have any comments or questions, feel free to contact me via my <a href="mailto:sullamij@gmail.com">mail</a>
